In this project, I perform an end-to-end analysis on a unique dataset.

Given an unprocessed dataset, I clean, explore, visualize, and analyze the data, while comparing the performance of various classifiers that are being tested on said data. 

The uncleaned dataset can be found in the repository. Running the Jupyter notebook will give live analysis on the dataset.
