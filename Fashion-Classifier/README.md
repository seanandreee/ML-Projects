# FashionMNIST Classifier

This project implements a simple neural network classifier for the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch. The FashionMNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items, each labeled with one of ten classes.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory to store the FashionMNIST dataset.
- `fashion-classifier.py`: Main script to define, train, and evaluate the neural network model.
- `model.pth`: Saved model state after training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
